# potholedetection
Project repository for Pothole detection
One of the main factors of road accidents and damage to vehicles is the presence of potholes. 
This project is to create a system that recognize potholes in images. This model is build on convolutional neural network (CNN) which can distinguish between roads with and without potholes.
